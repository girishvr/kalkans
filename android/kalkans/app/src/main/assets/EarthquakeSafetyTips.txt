IF SHAKING BEGINS
 Drop down; take cover under a desk or table and hold on.

 Stay indoors until the shaking stops and you're sure it's safe to exit.

 Stay away from bookcases or furniture that can fall on you

 Stay away from windows. In a high-rise building, expect the fire alarms and sprinklers to go off during a quake.

 If you are in bed, hold on and stay there, protecting your head with a pillow.

 If you are outdoors, find a clear spot away from buildings, trees, and power lines. Drop to the ground.

 If you are in a car, slow down and drive to a clear place. Stay in the car until the shaking stops.
