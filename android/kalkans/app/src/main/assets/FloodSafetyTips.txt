        Safety measures


﻿Tips to come out of distress condition

1.Turn Around, Don’t Drown!
2.Avoid walking or driving through flood waters.
3.Do not drive over bridges that are over fast-moving floodwaters.
4.Floodwaters can scour foundation material from around the footings and make the bridge unstable.
5.Just 6 inches of moving water can knock you down, and one foot of moving water can sweep your vehicle away.
6.If there is a chance of flash flooding, move immediately to higher ground.
7.If floodwaters rise around your car but the water is not moving, abandon the car and move to higher ground. Do not leave the car and enter moving water.
8.Avoid camping or parking along streams, rivers, and creeks during heavy rainfall. These areas can flood quickly and with little warning.
